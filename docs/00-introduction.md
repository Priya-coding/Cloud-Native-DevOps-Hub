# Cloud-Native DevOps Hub

## Introduction
The **Cloud-Native DevOps Hub** is a real-world, practical project designed to showcase best practices in **AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, SSO, JWT, and Monitoring**. This project follows a structured and modular approach to deploying secure, scalable, and automated microservices in the cloud.

## Key Features
âœ… **Authentication & Security** â€“ Uses AWS SSO and JWT for secure access.  
âœ… **Kubernetes-Based Deployment** â€“ Deploys microservices on AWS EKS.  
âœ… **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)** â€“ Automates cloud setup for AWS.  
âœ… **CI/CD Automation** â€“ Uses GitHub Actions and ArgoCD for deployments.  
âœ… **Monitoring & Logging** â€“ Implements Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki for observability.  
âœ… **Load & Performance Testing** â€“ Uses JMeter for API stress testing.  
âœ… **Cost-Free Deployment** â€“ Built entirely using AWS Free Tier and open-source tools.

## System Architecture Overview
This project consists of the following core components:
- **User Authentication & API Gateway** â€“ Secure API access using AWS Cognito, JWT, and API Gateway.
- **Microservices Architecture** â€“ Services deployed using Kubernetes on AWS EKS.
- **Database Layer** â€“ PostgreSQL hosted on AWS RDS Free Tier.
- **Infrastructure Management** â€“ Terraform for provisioning AWS resources.
- **CI/CD Pipeline** â€“ GitHub Actions automates testing, builds Docker images, and deploys to EKS.
- **Monitoring & Logging** â€“ Grafana dashboards, Prometheus metrics, and Loki logs.
- **Load Testing** â€“ JMeter to simulate high-traffic API usage.

## Project Roadmap
This project is structured into **phases**, implemented step by step:
1. **Infrastructure Setup (Terraform on AWS Free Tier)**  
2. **Authentication Service (JWT + AWS SSO)**  
3. **Microservices Deployment (AWS EKS + PostgreSQL RDS)**  
4. **CI/CD Automation (GitHub Actions + ArgoCD)**  
5. **Monitoring & Logging (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki)**  
6. **Load Testing & Final Performance Optimization**  

## Next Steps
- Set up Terraform for **AWS EKS, IAM, and S3** in the next phase.
- Deploy the Authentication Service and API Gateway.
- Document all steps for learning and reference.

Stay tuned for detailed technical documentation in the upcoming sections!
